# Assumptions

These assumptions help refine theoretical models into more specific instance models to be implemented in our software.

The design and implementation of the software should accommodate the possibility of the likely to change assumptions removed or relaxed in the future.

> Unlike the [Software Scope](software-scope.md), the assumptions are used to refine the models. In theory, the problem and solution should still somewhat hold even if the assumptions are relaxed/removed.  
> Some of these likely to change assumptions may also be related to what we would consider a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), so that we do not have to tackle all the complexities at once. 

## Likely to Change
#### A1
The object only experiences drag and no lift in the flight.
#### A2
Air density does not change with altitude.
#### A3
Wind is constant along the flight path.

## Unlikely to Change
#### A4
The curvature of the Earth is negligible.
#### A5
Gravity does not change with altitude or location.
