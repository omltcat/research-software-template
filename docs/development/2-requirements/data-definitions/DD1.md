# DD1: Sum of Forces

| Symbol | Unit |
| --- | --- |
| $\sum\mathbf{F}$ | $\text{N}$ |

## Equation
$$
\sum\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{F_D}
$$

## Description
The sum of all forces acting on the object.

This can include forces like drag ($\mathbf{F_D}$), lift ($\mathbf{F_L}$), thrust ($\mathbf{F_T}$), etc.

## Notes
As for now we only consider the drag force ($\mathbf{F_D}$) in $\sum\mathbf{F}$, as discussed in [Assumptions](../assumptions.md).
