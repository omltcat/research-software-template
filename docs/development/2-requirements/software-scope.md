# Software Scope
> Here we limit the scope of the software to a manageable size, so that it can be completed within a reasonable time and with available resources.  
> The scope will give us an idea of what we definitely **will not do**, even in future versions, so that we do not need to considering accommodating those aspects in our design.  
> Generally, we set these boundaries because there is not really a need to cross them with our target users, or the barrier to overcome any related difficulties is impractical in the foreseeable future.  
> There are **NOT** [assumptions](assumptions.md), which are to help us refine the theoretical model.

> e.g. We are building a trajectory simulation software...

- Only simulate in 3D space, no 2D cases.
- Only consider Newtonian physics, no relativistic effects.
