# TM1: Velocity Differential Equation

## Equation
$$
\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \frac{\sum\mathbf{F}}{m} - \mathbf{g}
$$

## Description
This differential equation describes the change in velocity at each time step ($\Delta t$) given the forces acting on the object and the gravitational acceleration.

- $\mathbf{F}$ is the sum of all forces acting on the object.

- $\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration vector, pointing downwards.
- $m$ is the mass of the object.

## Notes
To use this differential equation, we need to start from an initial velocity $\mathbf{v}_0$ and update the velocity at each time step.
