# Glossary
For easy reference across all documents.

## Units of Measurement
| Symbol | Unit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $\text{m}$ | meter | Length |
| $\text{kg}$ | kilogram | Mass |
| $\text{s}$ | second | Time |

## Symbols Representations
| Symbol | Unit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $t$ | $\text{s}$ | time since start of simulation |
| $\bold{v}$ | $\text{m/s}$ | velocity vector |
| $\bold{a}$ | $\text{m/s}^2$ | acceleration vector |

## Abbreviations and Acronyms
| Symbol | Description |
| --- | --- |
| SRS | Software Requirements Specification |
| V&V | Verification and Validation |
| IC | Initial Conditions |

Also list them in [this format](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/tooltips/#adding-abbreviations), so a tooltip appears whenever user hovers over an abbreviation/acronym like SRS. The list itself is not visible in the rendered page.

*[SRS]: Software Requirements Specification  
*[V&V]: Verification and Validation  
*[IC]: Initial Conditions  

## Mathematical Notation
In all documents, the following notation is used:
<!-- Change to your domain specific common notations -->
- Bold font denotes vectors (e.g. $\bold{v}$)
- | | denotes the modulus (magnitude) of a vector (e.g. $|\bold{v}|$)

## Key Concepts
These are domain specific concepts that may be common knowledge within the domain. However, for outside readers who just want to quickly go over the documents, they can use this section as a crash course.  
> Write these as a list as they can be longer and more detailed than the abbreviations/acronyms.  
> You may need to come back and add more as you write more documents.
- **Fluid Dynamics**: The study of matters that can “flow”, including gases (like air)
and liquids (like water), and how they interact with other objects (such as an aircraft).
