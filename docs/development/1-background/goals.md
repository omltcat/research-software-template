# Project Goals

## Immediate Goals
> What are we trying to achieve with this software?  
> It is just about WHAT the software should do, but not yet about HOW to do it.  
> This is what any immediate user wants in short term, as a minimum viable product (MVP).

## Stretch Goals
> Given enough time and resources, what more can we achieve with this software?  
> This will make it more useful for any potential user.
