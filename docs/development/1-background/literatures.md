# Literatures
Papers, articles, and books that are relevant to the problem and proposed solutions.

> Use this page to document potentially useful literatures and what each of them is about.  
> Make sure to put their $\LaTeX$ reference in `references.bib` for citation from anywhere on this website.  
> Put key concepts as bullet points in [Quick References](quick-ref.md) for quick reference, so that non-domain readers can quickly grasp the domain specific terms and concepts and not have to read through entire papers to understand the documents.  

> Change the categorization of the literatures as needed.

## Domain Background
Sources that provide more background understanding of the domain, should anyone need a better understanding.  
People likely do not need to read these if are already familiar with the domain.

## Solutions
