# Feasibility Considerations

> Unless you are somehow required to do a full "feasibility study" for your project, we are only going to have some light considerations here.

## Similar Projects
> List some project that you know of or provided by the domain expert, which tackle similar problems or in the same field.  
> You don't need to dig too deep here. Some light searching should be enough. If you found nothing similar, so be it.

## Possible Tech Stack
> Given your current knowledge of the problem and possible solutions, what technologies (programming languages, libraries, APIs, etc.) do you think are suitable for this project?  
> **This is NOT the software design!** It is just a general idea of what you think might be an easier path to take. You are not committed to anything here.
